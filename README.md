This is a simple [Next.js] + [Babylon.js] starter.

This starter runs best when using pnpm.

## Getting Started

First install node modules: 

```

$ pnpm install

```

Then run the development server:

```

pnpm dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
You will also find two scene folders (eg: `components/SceneOne`), where you can edit your scene(s).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
